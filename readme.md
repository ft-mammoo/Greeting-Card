  Adapts gracefully from mobile (320px) up to desktop (1200px+) using flexible containers and media queries.

- **Semantic HTML5**  
  Clean structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for accessibility and SEO.

- **CSS Animations & Transitions**  
  Subtle hover effects on buttons and an entrance animation for the card itself.
